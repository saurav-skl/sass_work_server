It's backend, hosted on Heroku.<br>
I have build two separate Frontend App, one for Client, and one for Admin.<br>
Client can use our platform and do his stuffs, in future they have to login, so that we can track his activity separately. <br>
In Admin, we can track for each users separately, for now, in admin dashboard it displays the count for every item clicked by any user.<br>
Client Side(code): https://github.com/saurav-skl/sass_work_client <br>
Client Side(live): https://sass-user.netlify.app/  <br>
<br>
Admin Side(code): https://github.com/saurav-skl/sass_work_admin <br>
Admin Side(live): https://sass-admin.netlify.app/ <br>
<br>
For now, Applications tracks following activities, <br>
Navbar Button(Icon) <br>
Welcome Button(Navbar) <br>
Images(User have to click on Star Button on images) <br>
