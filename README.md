It's backend, hosted on Heroku.
I have build two separate Frontend App, one for Client, and one for Admin.
Client can use our platform and do his stuffs, in future they have to login, so that we can track his activity separately. 
In Admin, we can track for each users separately, for now, in admin dashboard it displays the count for every item clicked by any user.
Client Side(code): https://github.com/saurav-skl/sass_work_client
Client Side(live): https://sass-user.netlify.app/

Admin Side(code): https://github.com/saurav-skl/sass_work_admin
Admin Side(live): https://sass-admin.netlify.app/

For now, Applications tracks following activities,
Navbar Button(Icon)
Welcome Button(Navbar)
Images(User have to click on Star Button on images)
